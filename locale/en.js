	"ships": {
		"Standard Fighter": "Once described as \"the perfect ship for war on a budget\", the Standard Fighter is designed for mass production at the lowest cost to get weapons into space.\n\nEquipped with two low-power weapon hardpoints and a basic shield system, the Standard Fighter does well against unarmed civilian targets and poorly defended medical ships.",
		"Longsword Corvette": "The Longsword Corvette is really long."
	},

	"weapons": {
		"Classic Laser": "The best selling weapon system for over two decades. While not actually a laser, the Classic Laser fires deadly bolts of charged plasma - giving it the trademark red glow.\n\nHighly effective against fast moving targets.",
		"MX-01 Missile": "While an older weapon system, the MX-01 Missile rapidly tracks targets and causes a small nuclear explosion at the impact point. Useful on well armoured, slow moving vessels or overly aggressive asteroids.",
		"Purple Beam": "The high energy \"Purple Beam\" weapon system fires a charged stream of meson particles along its a focused magnetic beam. An extremely heavy weapon system, the beam is most effective against slow, shielded targets."
